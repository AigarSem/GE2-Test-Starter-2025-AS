## What is happening

- Pressing P causes upward force on  the drone. 
- Pressing W and S causes foward and back force
- Pressing A and D rotates the drone 
- The props speeed up to a max speed when the force is applied and slow to a stop when force is removed 
- The camera lerps to a position behind the drone and looks at it

## Tips
- Use a RigidBody3D for the drone body
- You don't need to use steering behaviors 
- Use a subscene for the prop arm
- Use a subscene for the drone and instiantiate it in a main scene
- Commit often
